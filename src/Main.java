/**
 *
 *
 *   Welcome to the 'Dragon Slayer' game!
 *   In this game there are battle arenas.
 *   In each area live different monsters.
 *   If our player can defeat the monsters, he gets gold.
 *   If the player runs away instead of battling, his health and gold will be reduced.
 *   As the arena level rises, the monsters become stronger and give more gold.
 *   Final arena is The Dungeon Of Dragon.
 *   The King captured by this dragon is waiting to be rescued.
 *   If our player can slay the dragon, the king will honor our player by giving him a crown.
 *   When our player takes the King's Crown, he wins the game.
 *   There is a Market. Our player can buy armors, weapons and legendary items.
 *   There is a Health Room in the game. If player goes there, his health increases randomly.
 *   There is also a Petshop. Player can buy a new pet just for fun.
 *   If our player goes the base, he can see the items he has.
 *
 *
 *  Have a good time!
